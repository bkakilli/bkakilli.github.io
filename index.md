Iâ€™m a scientist and engineer. My expertise is in computer vision and machine intelligence. Also interested in robotics and embedded systems. I enjoy building stuff. Certainly a DIY-person. Hobbies include building autonomous things or tech gadgets, skiing, water sports, killing hours on random computer-related stuff.

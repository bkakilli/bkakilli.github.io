I’m a PhD Candidate on Electrical and Computer Engineering at Syracuse University. I work with Dr. Senem Velipasalar at the Smart Vision Systems Lab. My main research interests are 3D computer vision and machine learning. I’m also interested in robotics and embedded systems. I enjoy coding and building stuff.

I’m currently doing my Ph.D on Electrical and Computer Engineering at Syracuse University. I work with Dr. Senem Velipasalar in her Smart Vision Systems group. My main research interests are 3D computer vision and deep learning. I’m also interested in machine intelligence and embedded systems. I enjoy coding. Other than nerd stuff, I do have hobies.

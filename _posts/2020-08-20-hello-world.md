The title is the ultimate phrase that thrills those who truly passionate about the digital world. Because, to me it is that blinding brightness that welcomes you when you opened the big door to the outside world. It feels that it is the beginning of endless possibilities. I know it is the common practice to use it on the coding tutorials. But nothing holds you to feel the same way when you begin, well, virtually anything. That's why I would like to salute my adventure with this phrase since it perfectly represents my excitement right now.

Today's date is August 20, 2020 and it's midnight. I finally started to spit out the first words of my long overdue blog. Something tells me that today will not be the day of me finishing this page and publish. We will see. I am not a romantic type. In fact, I could be the opposite of romantic since my best man used to call me "Mr. Reason" when we were in college. And I am definitely not a man of letters. I hated writing during the school years (and my teachers hated my writing too, or perhaps they couldn't read it. Anyways.) but since it is a part of my academic career now, I am kind of used to it. Besides, I feel that expressing myself with texts is usually simpler and more effective way to convey my thoughts to others (until we eventually invent an alternative and more efficient communication channel among each other). On top of everything, my main motive with this blog is to have a log of my life for my records and loved ones.

Enough of pretty words. My awesome cool blog may contain posts about virtually anything happened in my life. But I will likely to put things more about my work and digital/tech stuff. I am a strong believer of "the best way to learn is to teach". I am not going to try creating perfect learning materials here. But instead there will be some keynotes and reference points, especially for myself, to digest stuff and recall when I need them later. If I can put a quality and original work, I will also share it on public domains, like Medium. So, the main audience of this blog is myself. But don't hesitate to be a part of it!
